## Consuming data directly from the Habitica's API

If you don't know [Habitica](https://habitica.com/), you should. It is a very fun way to improving yourself by gamifing your personal life challenges.

That being said, I had two goals with this project:
* To consume an external API;
* To do that using AngularJS;

It has a very brute look (Maybe I'll add some real CSS in the future, maybe I won't) but it acomplishes my goal.

[Habitica's API](https://habitica.com/apidoc/) has several restrictions including that for each request made you need to insert some data from your personal account.

The data that is shown refers to my own character, a _fighter_.

To run the project clone this repository and open the `index.html` file.

This one was fun. Thank you for reading until here :heart:
